Creating hbm file
------------------
HBM stands for hibernate mapping
We will have to map persistent class with the database table
This mapping must be configured into an xml file
This xml file will be used by hibernate
This file is known as hbm file
We will have to write following code for mapping

<hibernate-mapping> 
  <class name="com.cetpa.Employee" table="employeeinfo">
   <id name="eid" column="eid">
    <generator class="assigned" />
   </id>
   <property name="name" column="name"/>
   <property name="department" column="dept"/>
   <property name="salary" column="salary"/>
  </class>	   
</hibernate-mapping>  

Name of this file should be hibernate.hbm.xml and this file must be created inside src/main folder
