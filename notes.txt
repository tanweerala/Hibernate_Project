Hibernate framework
--------------------
It is an ORM(object relational mapping) tool
It is an implementation of JPA(Java persistence API)
This framework is used to perform database operations such as creating tables,inserting record into table,updating record,deleting record,filtering record,etc
Hibernate will call JDBC API to perform above tasks

ORM
---
ORM stands for object relational mapping
Every ORM tool maps object(created by program) with records in table
Let us suppose our program wants to insert record of an employee into table
If our program is using ORM tool then
1)Program will create an object of Employee class and keep data into that object
2)Program will give reference of this object to the ORM tool
3)ORM tool will insert data of object as a record into table by calling JDBC API

Inserting data of the object into table is called persisting object
