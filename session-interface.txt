Session interface
-----------------
Our program will create object of this interface and call methods of this interface to perform DML and DQL operation
Sesison session=factory.openSession();

Transaction interface
----------------------
DML operation can be performed without calling begin() and commit() method of this interface
It means our program will also create object of this interface and call beign() and commit() method of this interface
Transaction t=session.getTransaction();
