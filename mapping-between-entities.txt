Mapping between entities(persistent classes)
---------------------------------------------
We can implement following two mapping between persistent classes
1)Association mapping
2)Inheritance mapping

Association mapping
-------------------
This mapping is required when object of a class is creates and used by other classes
Association mapping can be of following 4 types
1)One to one mapping
2)One to many mapping
3)Many to one mapping
4)Many to many mapping

One to one mapping
-------------------
One instance of first entity is associated with only one instance of second entity.Similarly one instance of second entity is associated with only one instance of first entity
For example association between adharcard and person
